          It is an ongoing theme that users do not realise that they can click on the flood extents to find further information. ​In August 2025 we introduced a Map hints pop up, however testing revealed that most users closed this before reading it. Here we test a 'help' banner instead.
      - text: "Draw boundary menu options added​"

          March 25 – 'Add' for draw boundary adds a square that can be edited​, Prototype [Oct 25] –Two draw boundary methods. Add polygon allows 'click to draw' and add square​
      - text: "Square can't be edited​"

        alt: Screenshot of uneditable square boundary in the new design
        caption: |
          Square boundary live since March 2025 is editable by clicking 'edit shape' nodes then appear which can be moved. The square boundary tested in October 2025 remains square. User can pan and zoom to select the area they want.
      - text: "Zoom level can be freely adjusted​"

        caption: |
          Previously to limit the size of boundary users could draw they could only zoom out so far. This has beenrelaxed because we implemented a new method to handle large boundaries.​
      - text: "Boundary dimensions & map scale added"
        src: scale-bar-dimensions.png
        alt: Screenshot of prevous map with no scale bar or dimentions panel, along side map now with scale bar with boundary dimentions shown in panel
        caption: |
          March 25 – no indication of scale​, [Oct 25] – dimensions panel to show Area in hectares and scale in km​ shown via a scale bar
      - text: "New large boundary journey​"
        src: large-boundary.png
        alt: Screenshots showing sections of the user journey - the banner with 300 ha max restriction, 'modal pop-up'saying you cannot order a product four unles you reduce your boundary, and the results page again directing to edit boundary size to proceed.
        caption: |
          Previously zoom level was used to artificially limit how big a boundary could be. But people were finding ways around this. Now if a boundary is over 300ha a banner will appear and they can’t order a P4 via the website. We also tested a ‘modal pop-up’ that provides more information before people get to the results page.
