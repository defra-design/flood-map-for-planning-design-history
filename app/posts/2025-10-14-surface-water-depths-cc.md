          Depth information is available for present day and climate change surface water data for 1 in 30, 1 in 100, and 1 in 1000 AEPs. You can see all depths together, or toggle through different depth bands.

          'How to use this data' page contains a new sentence about the climate change epoch and allowance for surface water.

        caption: |
          To help with being able to see map detail and differentiate between different colours the user can control the layer opacity. It is set at 75% by default and can be changed from 0 – 100%.
